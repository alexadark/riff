# /riff:next

Pick the next phase from ROADMAP.yaml, plan it, execute it, review it, open a PR.

**Models:** see [`protocols/MODEL.md`](../protocols/MODEL.md). Parent is forced to Opus via frontmatter. Sub-agents MUST pass `model:` explicitly on the Agent tool call.

**Inline vs sub-agent:** Steps 1–4, 8, 9, 10 run inline. Steps 4b, 5, 5b, 6, 7, 7b, 8a spawn sub-agents.

**Auto-gate heuristics:** see [`protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md). Design rationale: see [`DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) (D25–D27).

## Arguments

- No args → auto-pick next (highest priority, deps met, not blocked)
- `--plan-only` → create plan but don't execute
- `[phase-number]` → target a specific phase

## Loop

```
Read state → Pick next → Confidence gate → Plan → Execute → Review → PR → (merge) → Update state on main
```

### Step 1: Read state (inline)

Read: ROADMAP.yaml, STATE.md, PROJECT.md (skim), previous SUMMARY.md and VERIFICATION.md.

**Read project scope** from `.planning/config.json` → `scope` field. If absent or file missing → default to `production`. Hold this value; it gates Steps 4b, 5b, 6, 7 below.

### Step 2: Pick next phase (inline)

1. Filter `status: todo` phases where all `depends_on` are `done`
2. Sort by `priority` (P0 first)
3. AFK mode → filter to `mode: AFK` only
4. Last VERIFICATION.md has `FAIL` → don't pick new; create fix plan on existing branch

**Seed check:** scan `.planning/seeds/`. Seed's `trigger:` met → surface it. AFK → log only.

### Step 2b: Phase branch (inline)

```bash
git checkout -b riff/phase-N-slug
```

### Step 3: Confidence gate (inline)

See `protocols/EXECUTION.md` § Confidence Gate. Any dimension < 0.7 → STOP.

---

### Step 4: Plan — INLINE

Parent has already read state + ROADMAP + previous SUMMARY. Do NOT spawn a sub-agent.

Inject thinking keyword per MODEL.md § Planner selection.

1. Re-read if not in context: `taste.md`, `.planning/expertise/planner.md`, previous phase SUMMARY.md. If `.planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN-REVIEW.md` exists (revision cycle from Step 4b), read it and address every `BLOCKER` finding before rewriting PLAN.md.
2. [KEYWORD] Draft the plan. Break into waves. Mark independent tasks with `parallel: [task-A, task-B]` (independent = zero shared files)
3. Write to `.planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN.md`. Do NOT update STATE.md or ROADMAP.yaml
4. Include `## Model Recommendation`: default `executor_model: sonnet`. Recommend `opus` ONLY for novel architecture, 10+ tightly coupled files, unfamiliar external APIs

---

### Step 4b: Plan adversarial review — sub-agent (gated)

**Skip if `scope: scratch`.** Personal/local apps don't need adversarial plan review.

Runs before execution so the planner can revise BEFORE code is written. Plan-stage fixes cost ~10x less than code-stage fixes.

**Gate:** `plan_adversarial:` from the phase's ROADMAP.yaml entry (`true` | `false` | `auto`; default `auto`).

- `false` → skip (log to `.planning/phases/N-slug/GATES.md`: `Step 4b: skipped — gate=false`)
- `true` → run (skip overrides do NOT apply when gate is explicit `true`)
- `auto` → see [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#plan-adversarial-auto`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#plan-adversarial-auto)

**Skip overrides (only when gate resolves to `auto`):** before spawning, check the skip overrides in [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#plan-adversarial-auto`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#plan-adversarial-auto). If any fires, append a one-line entry to `.planning/phases/N-slug/GATES.md` (`Step 4b: skipped — <reason>`) and continue to Step 5 without spawning Codex.

**If running:** Agent tool → skill `codex:codex-rescue`. Append `Step 4b: ran — model={{MODEL}} effort={{EFFORT}}` to `GATES.md` after completion.

**Resolve model + effort** per [`protocols/MODEL.md`](../protocols/MODEL.md) § Codex model + effort. Default for Step 4b: `gpt-5.5 medium`. Per-phase `codex_model:` / `codex_effort:` override.

Prompt: phase goal (one line), branch, instruction _"Run with `--model {{MODEL}} --effort {{EFFORT}}`. Read `agents/plan-adversarial-reviewer.md`. Read `.planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN.md`, PROJECT.md, the ROADMAP.yaml entry for phase N, and `taste.md` sections relevant to the phase surface. Apply the protocol. Write `.planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN-REVIEW.md` with PROCEED or REVISE verdict."_

**On REVISE:**

1. Surface PLAN-REVIEW.md to user (paste the Findings section).
2. Re-run Step 4 (planner, inline) with PLAN-REVIEW.md as additional input. Planner addresses each `BLOCKER`, optionally addresses `WARNING`/`NOTE`, rewrites PLAN.md in place.
3. Re-run Step 4b. Loop until PROCEED.
4. Max 2 revision cycles, then STOP and escalate to user with both PLAN.md and PLAN-REVIEW.md.

**On PROCEED:** continue.

If `--plan-only` was passed: STOP here. The PLAN.md and PLAN-REVIEW.md are the deliverables.

---

### Step 5: Execute — sub-agent

**Model:** `sonnet` default. ROADMAP.yaml `executor_model:` wins over PLAN.md's recommendation.

**Thinking:** none by default. `think hard` if `complex_execution: true`.

**Parallel tasks:** tasks marked `parallel:` MUST launch as separate sub-agents in a single message. Sequential tasks stay inline within the executor.

Agent prompt (give paths — do NOT paste file contents):

- Branch: `riff/phase-N-slug`
- Read: `.planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN.md`, `taste.md`, `.planning/expertise/executor.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- Instruction: _"FIRST: verify you are on branch `riff/phase-N-slug`. Read PLAN.md and execute all tasks. For tasks marked `parallel:`, launch them as separate sub-agents in a single message. Commit after each task (conventional format, stage explicitly). Write `.planning/phases/N-slug/SUMMARY.md`."_

Wait until SUMMARY.md exists on disk.

**Auto-debug trigger:** scan SUMMARY.md for `FAILED` / `ERROR` / `unresolved` / incomplete tasks. Found → run auto-debug pattern (below) with `failure_type: executor_fail`, `artifact: SUMMARY.md`.

---

### Step 5b: Simplify — sub-agent (gated)

**Skip if `scope: scratch`.** Personal/local code doesn't need a simplifier pass.

Runs before review so reviewers audit simplified code.

**Gate:** `simplify:` from the phase's ROADMAP.yaml entry (`true` | `false` | `auto`; default `auto`).

- `false` → skip
- `true` → always run
- `auto` → see [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#simplifier-auto`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#simplifier-auto)

**If running:** Agent tool, `model: "haiku"`.

Prompt: branch name, phase N-slug, instruction _"Read `agents/simplifier.md`. Scope: diff of branch `riff/phase-N-slug` against main only. Apply the protocol. Write `.planning/phases/N-slug/REFACTOR.md`. Commit simplifications as separate `refactor(phase-N): ...` commits, staging explicitly."_

---

### Step 5c: Scope check (inline)

Before review, verify executor honored the plan. Run scope-checker sub-agent.

**Agent:** Agent tool, model: haiku. Prompt: _"Read agents/scope-checker.md. Branch: riff/phase-N-slug. Read .planning/phases/N-slug/PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md. Diff task lists. Return MATCH | DROPPED: <list> | MALFORMED: <reason>."_

**On DROPPED:** STOP. AskUserQuestion: for each dropped task, pick "completed (mark done in SUMMARY)" | "defer to new phase (will run /riff:add-phase)" | "rejected (write rationale)". Apply the user's choice for each, then re-run Step 5c. Loop until MATCH.

**On MALFORMED:** surface the parsing error to user, ask whether to skip (acceptable for unstructured PLAN.md formats) or fix the format and retry.

**On MATCH:** proceed to Step 6.

---

### Steps 6 + 7: Adversarial + Security — IN PARALLEL

**Skip BOTH if `scope: scratch`.** Personal/local apps don't run adversarial review or security-reviewer. Jump to Step 8 (PR creation). Belt-and-suspenders: security-reviewer.md also self-skips when scope=scratch in case it's invoked manually.

Launch BOTH in a single message.

**Step 6 (Adversarial — Codex):** Agent tool → skill `codex:codex-rescue`.

**Gate:** `adversarial:` from the phase's ROADMAP.yaml entry (`true` | `false` | `auto`; default `auto`).

- `false` → skip (log to `.planning/phases/N-slug/GATES.md`: `Step 6: skipped — gate=false`)
- `true` → run (skip overrides do NOT apply when gate is explicit `true`)
- `auto` → see [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#adversarial-auto`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#adversarial-auto)

**Skip overrides (only when gate resolves to `auto`):** before spawning, check the skip overrides in [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#adversarial-auto`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#adversarial-auto). If any fires, append a one-line entry to `.planning/phases/N-slug/GATES.md` (`Step 6: skipped — <reason>`) and continue without spawning Codex (security review still runs in parallel).

**Resolve model + effort** per [`protocols/MODEL.md`](../protocols/MODEL.md) § Codex model + effort. Defaults by `budget_quality`: `frugal` → `gpt-5.4-mini minimal`; `balanced` → `gpt-5.4 medium`; `max` → `gpt-5.5 medium`. Per-phase `codex_model:` / `codex_effort:` override.

**If running:** prompt includes phase goal (one line), branch, instruction _"Run with `--model {{MODEL}} --effort {{EFFORT}}`. Run `git diff main...HEAD`. Run `npx vitest run` and `npx tsc --noEmit`. Review the diff for: logic bugs, race conditions, edge cases, missing error handling, off-by-one, incorrect assumptions. Write `.planning/phases/N-slug/REVIEW.md` with PASS/FAIL verdict."_ Append `Step 6: ran — model={{MODEL}} effort={{EFFORT}}` to `GATES.md` after completion.

- Auto-debug on FAIL → `failure_type: adversarial_fail`, `artifact: REVIEW.md`. On RESOLVED, re-run Step 6.

**Step 7 (Security — Sonnet):** Agent tool, `model: "sonnet"`. Thinking keyword per MODEL.md § Security selection. Prompt: `[KEYWORD]`, phase goal, instruction _"Run `git diff main...HEAD`. Read SUMMARY.md. OWASP scan on all changed files. CRITICAL/HIGH → mark blocked. Write findings inline."_

- Auto-debug on CRITICAL/HIGH → `failure_type: security_fail`, `artifact: [findings inline]`. On RESOLVED, re-run Step 7.

**Wait for BOTH.** If security CRITICAL/HIGH or adversarial FAIL → do NOT create PR.

### Step 7b: Improver — sub-agent (background, gated)

**Gate:** skip by default. See [`AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#improver-heuristic`](../protocols/AUTO-TRIGGERS.md#improver-heuristic) for run conditions.

**If running:** Agent tool, `model: "haiku"`, `run_in_background: true`.

Prompt: _"Read `.planning/phases/N-slug/SUMMARY.md` and `.planning/expertise/` files. Write learnings to `.planning/expertise/.pending/` if any. Do not auto-merge. Use Context7 or Ref MCP for recent libs."_

---

### Step 8: Create PR (inline)

Do NOT update ROADMAP.yaml or STATE.md on the feature branch.

**8a — Documentation check (BLOCKING):** compare SUMMARY.md against `.claude/references/project-details.md` (file tree), `docs/architecture.md` (service/route tables), `taste.md` (new patterns). Stale → spawn Haiku sub-agent to update before PR.

**8b — Push + PR:**

1. `git push -u origin riff/phase-N-slug`
2. `gh pr create` with phase title, artifacts, review + security status
3. **STOP. Do NOT merge.**

**8c — Update state after merge (inline):** wait for user to merge. Then on main:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git add ROADMAP.yaml STATE.md
git commit -m "type(phase-N): short description"
git push origin main
```

If user launches next phase immediately: skip 8c (state update happens at start of next `/riff:next`).

### Step 9: Learn (inline)

- Taste proposals: new pattern → append to taste.md with `<!-- PENDING -->`
- Seeds: check `.planning/seeds/` triggers

### Step 10: Report + usage (inline)

Collect `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, `duration_ms` from each Agent result.

Write `.planning/phases/N-slug/USAGE.md` using **`templates/usage.md`**.

Append to `.planning/usage-log.csv` (create with header if missing):

```csv
phase,title,date,total_tokens,duration_min,tool_calls,planner_tokens,executor_tokens,adversarial_tokens,security_tokens,debugger_tokens
```

Print:

```
Phase N: {{TITLE}} - {{VERDICT}}
Built: {{artifacts}}
Security: {{PASS/issues}}
Usage: {{total_tokens}}k tokens, {{duration}}min
Next: Phase {{N+1}}: {{NEXT_TITLE}}
```

### Pending expertise review (inline)

Compute pending count: `ls .planning/expertise/.pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l`. If 0 → skip this section.

If > 0, run AskUserQuestion:

> "{{N}} expertise patches pending. What do you want to do?"
>
> - **Review now** — walk per-pattern (recommended for staying coherent)
> - **Defer to next phase** — leave them in `.pending/`, will ask again at end of next phase
> - **Reject all** — wipe `.pending/` (with one confirmation step)

**Review now** flow (per-pattern):

1. Glob `.planning/expertise/.pending/*.md`. For each file, read it and identify each PATTERN inside (a file may contain multiple).
2. For each pattern, classify into one of three tiers:

   | Tier             | Scope                                                                                                  | Destination                                                                       |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Stack**        | Gotcha / convention for a tech (Drizzle, Zod, RR7, Vitest, etc.) that applies to any project using it | `~/DEV/frameworks/riff/references/taste/stacks/<stack>.md` (framework)            |
   | **Architecture** | Design principle, multi-tenant rule, security pattern applicable beyond one project                   | `~/DEV/frameworks/riff/references/taste/{architecture,security,backend,testing}.md` |
   | **Project**      | File paths, provider quirks, domain-specific patterns tied to this codebase                           | `.planning/expertise/<agent>.md` and/or project `taste.md`                        |

3. AskUserQuestion per pattern: **Accept (at tier X) / Reject / Edit / Re-tier**.
4. Apply the decision: append to destination (without `Justification` line for Project tier), remove pattern from pending file.
5. When all patterns in a pending file are handled, delete the pending file.
6. Auto-reject duplicates of existing rules and note them in the report.

Rules:
- Default to **Project** tier when unsure. Over-promotion to framework bloats references for all users.
- If a framework file exceeds 15 entries after append, warn to compress.
- When promoting to RIFF framework (Stack or Architecture tier), remind: "Existing projects won't auto-pick-up this rule, their `taste.md` was seeded at `/riff:start`. They'd need a manual sync."

**Defer** flow:
Print `Deferred. {{N}} patches stay in .planning/expertise/.pending/. Will ask again at the end of the next phase.` Do nothing else.

**Reject all** flow:
Confirm with one more AskUserQuestion ("Wipe all {{N}} patches? This is irreversible."). On confirm: `rm -f .planning/expertise/.pending/*.md`. Print `Rejected {{N}} patches.`

Report at end: `Reviewed: M accepted (stack/arch/project breakdown), K rejected, E edited, D deferred.`

---

## Auto-debug pattern

Shared by Steps 5, 6, 7. Skip if `auto_debug: false`.

**Model:** `opus` (or `sonnet` if `debug_model: sonnet`).

**Prompt:**

> Read `agents/debugger.md`. Branch: `riff/phase-N-slug`. Failure type: `{{failure_type}}`. Failure artifact: `{{artifact}}`. Phase path: `.planning/phases/N-slug/`. Diagnose, attempt fix, write `.planning/phases/N-slug/DEBUG.md`.

**After completion:**

- DEBUG.md `RESOLVED` → re-run originating step, UNLESS all of these hold:
  - debugger ran with `opus` (default)
  - debugger's verification block in DEBUG.md reports tests green + tsc clean
  - every finding in the originating artifact has a corresponding new test locking the fix

  In that case, accept RESOLVED as the verdict without a re-run. Surface in Step 10 report: `Re-run skipped: RESOLVED with pinning tests`.

- DEBUG.md `UNRESOLVED` → halt, surface DEBUG.md to user

---

## AFK mode

Skip human interaction. Proceed on Confident/Likely. STOP on: Unclear, R3, FAIL, CRITICAL/HIGH security, all done.

## Ground rules

- Give paths, never paste file contents into prompts
- Step 4 is inline — never a sub-agent (~7x token waste)
- Sub-agents need explicit `model:` on the Agent call — frontmatter inheritance is not enough
- Auto-debug artifacts (DEBUG.md) are required input for the next cycle — don't skip triggers
- One phase per `/riff:next` call
